Your contact form is now configured to send emails directly to `himanshusingh1088@gmail.com` using EmailJS. Follow these steps to complete the setup.

## 🔧 Setup Steps

### 1. Create EmailJS Account

5. Note down your **Service ID** (something like `service_xxxxxxx`)

### 3. Create Email Template
1. Go to **Email Templates** in your EmailJS dashboard
2. Click **Create New Template**
3. Use this template structure:

```html
Subject: {{subject}} - Portfolio Contact

From: {{from_name}} <{{from_email}}>

Hi Himanshu,

You have received a new message from your portfolio website:

Name: {{from_name}}
Email: {{from_email}}
Subject: {{subject}}

Message:
{{message}}

---
This message was sent from your portfolio contact form.
Reply directly to this email to respond to {{from_name}}.
```

4. Save the template and note down your **Template ID** (something like `template_xxxxxxx`)

### 4. Get Your Public Key

2. Find your **Public Key** (something like `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)

### 5. Update Configuration
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Open `.env` and replace the placeholder values with your actual EmailJS credentials:

```bash
# EmailJS Configuration
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_your_actual_id
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_your_actual_id
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_actual_public_key
VITE_EMAILJS_TO_EMAIL=himanshusingh1088@gmail.com
```

3. Save the file - your credentials are now secure and won't be committed to version control
